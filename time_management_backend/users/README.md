## Implementation Details

The User Management module will be implemented using Django's authentication system with custom extensions:

1. **Custom User Model**
   - Extends Django's AbstractUser
   - Adds fields for employee-specific information

2. **Profile Model**
   - One-to-one relationship with User
   - Contains extended profile information

3. **Preferences Model**
   - One-to-one relationship with User
   - Stores user preferences as JSON

4. **Permission Groups**
   - Predefined groups for each role
   - Custom permissions for specific actions

5. **Authentication Backend**
   - Token-based authentication
   - Support for MFA
   - Session management

## Integration Points

The User Management module integrates with:

1. **PTO Management**
   - User profiles linked to PTO balances
   - Permission checks for PTO requests

2. **Notification System**
   - User preferences determine notification delivery
   - User contact information for notifications

3. **Reporting System**
   - User hierarchy for report access
   - Department structure for organizational reports

4. **Accommodation Management**
   - User profiles linked to accommodation requests
   - Special permissions for accommodation approvals

## Next Steps

1. Implement the User and Profile models
2. Set up authentication endpoints
3. Configure permission groups and role-based access
4. Implement user preferences system
5. Create admin interfaces for user management
6. Set up notification preferences
7. Implement MFA and security features
